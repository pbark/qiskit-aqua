    ``OptimizationResult`` included some public setters and class variables
    were ``Optional``. This fix makes all class variables read-only so that
    mypy and pylint can check types more effectively.
    ``MinimumEigenOptimizer.solve`` generated bitstrings in a result as ``str``.
    This fix changed the result into ``List[float]`` as the other algorithms do.
    Some public classes related to optimization algorithms were missing in
    the documentation of ``qiskit.optimization.algorithms``. This fix added
    all such classes to the docstring.
    `#1131 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1131>` for more details.
